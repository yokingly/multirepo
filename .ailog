Recent Changes and Improvements:

1. System Architecture Visualization
- Created HowItWorksChart component to visualize the platform's architecture
- Added Gmail and Outlook session containers with realistic metrics
- Implemented connection visualization between platform and sessions
- Added animated dots to show real-time data flow
- Included session-specific metrics (emails sent, read, replies, clicks)
