# Email Automation System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Current email automation solutions rely heavily on OAuth2 and API integrations, which can lead to lower deliverability rates and potential flagging by email providers. There's a need for a more natural approach that mimics human behavior when sending emails.
